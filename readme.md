## Three traits in genetic algorithm: 
	- Heredity
	- Variation
	- Selection

### steps to setup:
	- create n elements with random DNA

#### steps to evolve:
	- evaluate fitness (often best done as a probability)
	- create a mating pool (often best done with a probability of survival)
	- crossover (creating a child from the two parents)
	- mutation (a low chance of mutation for each gene)

#### repeat evolution steps with children
